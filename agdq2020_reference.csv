Charity events likes this make me proud to be part of the gaming community and proud to be a lifelong gamer. The causes and foundations supported by these events help so many people, it is simply incredible. As the community grows and more and more people join these events, the world slowly and surely becomes a better place. Keep up the good work everyone!

Great job to the staff and runners for making this event raise so much for such a great cause. Already looking forward to SGDQ 2020.

I lost my friend Alice to cancer in August; she and I both came out as trans women around the same time online, and while I never met her IRL, she helped me come to terms with myself and was always a joy to chat with. I can't thank GDQ enough for raising so much to beat cancer, and for being so supportive of the LGBTQ+ community; let's save the frames, kill the cancer, and trans rights are human rights! <3

I could not do much from far away but here is my little contribution to a great cause, and it's my first time donating, the start of many to come.Thank you AGDQ and all those who donated for your generosity. You have, are, and will show the world not only how entertaining video games can be, but how people from all walks of life can be together as a community for a great cause.

Any day in the next couple of weeks he will pass and he has had a great life. Chris is an amazing human full of joy, love, and the best puns I've ever heard. I couldn't imagine knowing I'm going to die any day now. He is at peace and ready. Thank you AGDQ. I hope this helps us defeat cancer.
